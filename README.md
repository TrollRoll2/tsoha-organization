The project is a prototype/baseline for what an organization's site could look like. While visiting the site, the user may read questions and reviews left by other users and also view upcoming events from the organization. The site allows users to create an account and log in, which gives additional functionality to the user, such as leaving reviews and questions for the organization. Users also have the opportunity to interact with different parts of the site. They can view their own account and delete their questions and reviews. 

Admins have access to further functionality regarding the site, including checking the questions and reviews of accounts, approving and answering said questions, as well as adding upcoming events. They can also remove other users' questions.

In order to test the app the repository has to be cloned. A .env file will also have to be created with a custom SECRET_KEY and a DATABASE_URL. The schema and seed will initialize the database and admin user. The seed provides the admin logins: admin1, admin1
